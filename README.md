🔭 I’m currently working on ... an open-source IBP **Integrated Business Planning** App to help ELT (executive leadership teams) plan business better & faster.   

_**Product Goals**_
- Unite strategy + operations + finance in one place.
- Give execs visibility into trade-offs (capital, people, markets).
- Track performance vs. strategy continuously.
- Create competitive advantage by making planning faster, clearer, and adaptive.
